# bash_scripts

***Install.sh*** - Bash script to grab a few repositorites and programs for ctfs. Made just in case I'm in a pinch with a new machine before a ctf.

***apt_get_clean.sh*** - Clean apt-get APT library and/or dependancies.

***Static_malware_tools.sh*** - A few tools to install for static analysis.
